/*This type of algorithm can be solved by only one step or one operation*/
/*We can take different kinds of data as input here, but our total operation
will be always 1*/
/*Constant time operation*/

int a , b;  //O(1)
int result = a+b;  //O(1)
cout << result;  //O(1)

------------------------
Time Complexity = O(1+1+1) = O(1)
